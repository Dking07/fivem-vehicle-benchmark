## DESCRIPTION

DK Benchmark is a comprehensive vehicle performance testing tool for FiveM servers. This standalone resource provides real-time performance metrics for any vehicle in the game, allowing players to measure acceleration, top speed, and distance times with precision and style.

The benchmark displays a sleek, customizable UI that shows critical performance data including 0-60 MPH times, quarter-mile runs, top speed, and much more. Perfect for car enthusiasts, racing servers, vehicle developers, and anyone who wants to compare vehicle performance with accurate metrics.

## KEY FEATURES

- üöÄ **Comprehensive Performance Metrics**:
  - Speed benchmarks (0-60 MPH, 0-100 MPH, 0-120 MPH, etc.)
  - Distance benchmarks (‚Öõ Mile, ¬º Mile, ¬Ω Mile, 1 Mile, etc.)
  - Top speed measurement
  - Average times for all metrics

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Fully Customizable**:
  - Configurable speed and distance benchmarks
  - Adjustable UI position and scale
  - Customizable commands and key bindings
  - Support for both Imperial (MPH/Miles) and Metric (KPH/Kilometers) units

- üéÆ **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Clean, modern UI design
  - Real-time updates
  - Vehicle name and class display
  - Color-coded status indicators

- üîß **Advanced Functionality**:
  - Pause/resume benchmark testing
  - Reset functionality
  - Persistent settings between sessions

- **Versatile Commands**:
  - `/benchmark` - Toggle the benchmark display
  - `/movebenchmark` - Reposition the UI with drag-and-drop
  - `/resetbench` - Reset all benchmark data
  - `/pausebench` - Pause/resume the current benchmark
  - `/togglespeed` - Switch between MPH and KPH
  - `/toggledistance` - Switch between Miles and Kilometers
  - `/resetunits` - Reset to default unit settings
  - `/delbenchpos` - Reset UI position

## HOW IT WORKS

1. **Start the Benchmark**: Use the `/benchmark` command to display the UI
2. **Position the UI**: Use `/movebenchmark` to drag the UI to your preferred position
3. **Begin Testing**: Simply drive forward to automatically start the benchmark
4. **View Results**: Watch in real-time as the benchmark records your vehicle's performance
5. **Compare Results**: The benchmark keeps track of your recent times, showing averages for comparison

The benchmark automatically detects when you start moving forward and begins timing. It records when you hit specific speed thresholds and distance markers, providing accurate measurements of your vehicle's performance capabilities.

When you stop the vehicle, the benchmark saves your results and displays averages from your recent runs, allowing you to compare performance across multiple tests.
